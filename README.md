# GMatch4py a graph matching library for Python 


GMatch4py is a library dedicated to graph matching. Graph structure are stored in NetworkX graph objects.
GMatch4py algorithms were implemented with Cython to enhance performance.

## Requirements

 * Python 3
 * Numpy and Cython installed (if not : `(sudo) pip(3) install numpy cython`)
 
## Installation

To install `GMatch4py`, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jacobe2169/GMatch4py.git
cd GMatch4py
(sudo) pip(3) install .
```

## Get Started
### Graph input format

In `GMatch4py`, algorithms manipulate `networkx.Graph`, a complete graph model that 
comes with a large spectrum of parser to load your graph from various inputs : `*.graphml,*.gexf,..` (check [here](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/readwrite/index.html) to see all the format accepted)

### Use GMatch4py
If you want to use algorithms like *graph edit distances*, here is an example:

```python
# Gmatch4py use networkx graph 
import networkx as nx 
# import the GED using the munkres algorithm
import gmatch4py as gm
```

In this example, we use generated graphs using `networkx` helpers:
```python
g1=nx.complete_bipartite_graph(5,4) 
g2=nx.complete_bipartite_graph(6,4)
```

All graph matching algorithms in `Gmatch4py` work this way:
 * Each algorithm is associated with an object, each object having its specific parameters. In this case, the parameters are the edit costs (delete a vertex, add a vertex, ...)
 * Each object is associated with a `compare()` function with two parameters. First parameter is **a list of the graphs** you want to **compare**, i.e. measure the distance/similarity (depends on the algorithm). Then, you can specify a sample of graphs to be compared to all the other graphs. To this end, the second parameter should be **a list containing the indices** of these graphs (based on the first parameter list). If you rather compute the distance/similarity **between all graphs**, just use the `None` value.

```python
ged=gm.GraphEditDistance(1,1,1,1) # all edit costs are equal to 1
result=ged.compare([g1,g2],None) 
print(result)
```

The output is a similarity/distance matrix :
```python
array([[0., 14.],
       [10., 0.]])
```
This output result is "raw", if you wish to have normalized results in terms of distance (or similarity) you can use :

```python
ged.similarity(result)
# or 
ged.distance(result)
```

## Exploit nodes and edges attributes

In this latest version, we add the possibility to exploit graph attributes ! To do so, the `base.Base` is extended with the `set_attr_graph_used(node_attr,edge_attr)` method.

```python
import networkx as nx 
import gmatch4py as gm
ged = gm.GraphEditDistance(1,1,1,1)
ged.set_attr_graph_used("theme","color") # Edge colors and node themes attributes will be used.
```
